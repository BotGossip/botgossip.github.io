Gossip clients shall have four operating capabilities:
Receiving Lookups from clients (inbound GET) Sending Lookups to clients (outbound GET) Receiving Notifies from clients (inbound POST/PUT) Sending Notifies to clients (outbound POST/PUT) Clients are encouraged to support all above modes, however a client may only implement those that are necessary to the clientâ€™s operation. Of specific note, however, is that a client that supports receiving Notifies MUST additionally support receiving Lookups.</description></item><item><title>Schemas</title><link>https://gossip.rest/docs/fundamentals/schemas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gossip.rest/docs/fundamentals/schemas/</guid><description>Tier I - Core Attributes All Schemas contain a core set of required data known as Core Attributes. Any client capable of reporting information of this schema type MUST include all Core Attributes. Core Attributes MAY be null depending on the type of data, but the field values must be present.
Tier II - Extended Attributes Schemas may contain an extended set of in-specification data values. This data MAY be provided by clients if available, but clients SHALL NOT expect this data to be present.</description></item><item><title>Cases</title><link>https://gossip.rest/docs/resources/cases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gossip.rest/docs/resources/cases/</guid><description>This page needs to be moved to the API Reference, and rewritten according to the new route standards Cases are actions tied to a specific user.
