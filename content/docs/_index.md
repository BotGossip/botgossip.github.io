Welcome to the documentation for Gossip!

Gossip is an API specification to allow bots to communicate with each other. A typical use case for this would be to have multiple specialised bots all feed into one central system for cases/infractions, Gossip aims to make an open protocol to make standard implementations for this so any bot can participate in the system.
